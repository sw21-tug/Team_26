### Short Description
*TimeLog* is a simple app that allows to enter deadlines, appointments and other 
important tasks.  
The purpose of the app is to keep track of these important dates, don't miss them
and to save time.        

With *TimeLog*, users can:
 - Enter tasks (e.g. deadlines)
 - Create groups of tasks
 - View all tasks or just a single group as a simple list in chronological order
 - Share groups of tasks with other users (e.g. join group "Exams")
 - Get notifications for deadlines
 - Create, Update or delete tasks within a group so that everyone within the group   
   is immediately up-to-date
